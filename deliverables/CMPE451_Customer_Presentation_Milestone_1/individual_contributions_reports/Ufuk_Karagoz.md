* Group: [Group 9](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2022group9)
* Subgroup: Frontend

## Responsibilities
* Firstly, I created my personal pages as a new group member. Then, I updated the Readme file and project plan. The updated project plan file and Screen Shots were added to the wiki page. After that, I was assigned to the frontend subgroup and the coding part was implemented. I primarily code about the connection and architecture part of the front-end project. We chose to React for the frontend implementation. I used the Axios library for the backend API requests. The project manages the user states and tokens with Redux implementation. The last but not least, URL routing architecture was implemented. There are two different types of URLs such as public and authorized. Users cannot access authorized URLs without the login step and the information checked by using Redux's states.

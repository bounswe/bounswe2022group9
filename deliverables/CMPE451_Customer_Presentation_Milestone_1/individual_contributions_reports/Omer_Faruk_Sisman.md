## Responsibilities
I was mainly responsible for tasks related to backend and deployment of the application. I was responsible for initializing the project with Django on server side and connecting with Postgresql as our database. I was also responsible for dockerizing the application and deploying it to the EC2 instance on AWS. Then I was responsible for deploying Signup functionality together with both implementing and deploying Login functionality. Lastly I have initialized the deliverable files and prepared scenario before the customer presentation and the deadline for the Milestone.

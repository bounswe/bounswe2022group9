    iii) Managing project: Github for PRs and peer reviews
    
  * Frontend
    - React: It is the most common framework for web application development for now. Therefore we choose to implement on this framework. It has lots of tutorials and documents for using complex implementations. Also person who don't know React can easily adapt to coding with React because of javascript usage.
    - Axios: Axios library mainly using for API requests. For API requests we use Axios too. In the React applications the program sends POST or GET requests to backend and the response message will be waited. There has API documentation which is coming from backend and the program processes the response by using this API documentation.
    - Redux:The second popular UI library for React applications. Every member in the frontend group can smoothly start using this library. The components of our project has detailed features and the library give us the control of complex features and we can use every details by appling minor changes in the code.
    - Visual Studio Code: We choose this program for common coding platform. It is easy to use and lite program so everyone can handle with every devices.
    
  * Mobile
    - React Native: It is a very straightforward tool to getting started with mobile application development. We read its docs and watched some tutorials to get started. React native is still in a beta version, currently in 0.70, there is a lot of things to do make it a complete product but, this for course and for our application, after we analyzed the requirements, we decided that current situation of React Native is sufficient for us. So we chose React Native as our main development tool.
    - Expo: It is nearly nested with React Native. Actually, when you read React Native’s docs, it recommends using Expo. Main focus of Expo is easing the development process of react native apps. We used Expo to make our app ready and running while we write code. It enables you to see real time code changes in the simulator. Also, making APK releases with Expo is just a single line code, so we integrated it with our. Project.
    - Android Studio: We use this program to only use emulators built within it. So that when we run our code we can see what we are doing.

5. The requirements addressed in this milestone.
6. Overall description of responsibilities that are assigned to each member.
  * İbrahim Buğra Elmas
      - Creating a scheme for our mobile application and adding it to our repo. 
      - Main tasks until Customer Meeting 1 were adding login page, linking sign up feature of app with backend endpoint and creating a mockup for search page. 
      - Additionally, since added to this group this semester, some of responsibilities were understanding project and creating personal wiki page. taking notes in some meetings and revising PRs of subgroup friends. 
      - Revising sequence diagrams from last semester.
  * Ufuk Karagöz
      - I created my personal pages as a new group member.
      - I updated the Readme file and project plan. The updated project plan file and Screen Shots were added to the wiki page. 
      - I was assigned to the frontend subgroup and the coding part was implemented. I primarily code about the connection and architecture part of the front-end project. We chose to React for the frontend implementation. 
      - I used the Axios library for the backend API requests. The project manages the user states and tokens with Redux implementation. 
      - URL routing architecture was implemented. There are two different types of URLs such as public and authorized. Users cannot access authorized URLs without the login step and the information checked by using Redux's states.

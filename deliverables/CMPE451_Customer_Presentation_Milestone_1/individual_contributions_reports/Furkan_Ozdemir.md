## Responsibilites

I'm a member of backend group, so my overall duties are writing/testing backend code and helping to dockerization/deployment. First of all, I revised software
requirements. I joined all meetings that I should join. I made a research about dockerize & deploying django apps and I created a dockerfile (Later we used Omer's
dockerfile). I also worked on API documentation and wrote login part. I reviewed two pull request. First one was about backend code of login page. The second one was
about frontend code. Lastly, I created an installation and running guide for backend.

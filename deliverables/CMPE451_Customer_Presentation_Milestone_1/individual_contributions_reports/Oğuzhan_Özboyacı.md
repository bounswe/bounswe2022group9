## Responsibilites

I initially understood the project and created personal wiki page because i am a new member of this group. Also I rivised the scenarios and mockups.
My main tasks until the milestone1 were creating forget password page and creating feed page mockup. Since it is not ready i couldn't
link the forget password page to the backend endpoint. I also revied PRs of my subgroup friends.

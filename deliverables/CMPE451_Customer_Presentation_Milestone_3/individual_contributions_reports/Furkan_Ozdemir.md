I'm a member of backend group, so my overall duties are writing/testing backend code and helping to dockerization/deployment. 

I revised software requirements. 

I joined all meetings that I should join. 

I made a research about dockerize & deploying django apps and I created a dockerfile. 

I worked on API documentation and wrote login part.

I created an installation and running guide for backend.

I reviewed the pull requests about 
- backend code of login page. 
- frontend code of login page.
- backend code of like and comment. 

I created models for art items, exhibition and notification. I upgraded the model of user.

I wrote code for creating art items and image upload.

I documented 1 general meeting note and 1 backend meeting note. I also reuploaded class diagram images.

I made a research on annotations and I wrote code for annotations.

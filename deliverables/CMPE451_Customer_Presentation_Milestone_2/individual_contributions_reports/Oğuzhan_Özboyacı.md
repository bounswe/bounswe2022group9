## Responsibilities
After the first milestone, I have created settings page and exhibition page. In settings page fields for changing information about user's name, birthdate, email, 
profile photo and location. In the exhibition page, you can navigate to see your created exhibitions and you can create new exhibition with exhibition name, 
description of the exhibition, type of exhibition, location, starting time, ending time, date and art item which is included in the exhibition.

## Main Contributions

We have some user interfaces for mobile, however we have also missing user interfaces for settings and exhibition. I implemented those user interfaces.

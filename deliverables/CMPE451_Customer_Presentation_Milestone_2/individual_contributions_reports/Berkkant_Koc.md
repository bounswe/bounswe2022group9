## Responsibilities

I'm a member of backend group, this brings me responsibility of writing and testing backend code. My main responsibility in this milestone is
creating search engines for user, art item, and exhibiton. I have implemented these features. In the search bar, if a keyword is entered, I return all the
users, art items, and exhibitions related to this keyword.\
Furthermore, Frontend needed counts of followers/followings/art-items of a specific user. Then I implemented these features by writing helper functions 
editing API.

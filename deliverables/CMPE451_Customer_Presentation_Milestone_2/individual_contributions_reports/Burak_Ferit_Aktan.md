## Responsibilities

I'm a member of backend group, this brings me responsibility of writing and testing backend code. I wrote and tested backend codes for getting profile information, updating profile information and unfollow. I also documented the endpoints I have created.

Also, I'm taking meeting notes and documenting them on wiki page in some of the meetings. 

I created an empty project for Annotations, connected it to a PostgreSQL database and dockerized it.

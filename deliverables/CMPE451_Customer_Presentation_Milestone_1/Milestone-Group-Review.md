    - React Native: It is a very straightforward tool to getting started with mobile application development. We read its docs and watched some tutorials to get started. React native is still in a beta version, currently in 0.70, there is a lot of things to do make it a complete product but, this for course and for our application, after we analyzed the requirements, we decided that current situation of React Native is sufficient for us. So we chose React Native as our main development tool.
    - Expo: It is nearly nested with React Native. Actually, when you read React Native’s docs, it recommends using Expo. Main focus of Expo is easing the development process of react native apps. We used Expo to make our app ready and running while we write code. It enables you to see real time code changes in the simulator. Also, making APK releases with Expo is just a single line code, so we integrated it with our. Project.
    - Android Studio: We use this program to only use emulators built within it. So that when we run our code we can see what we are doing.

## Responsibilities

I was mainly responsible for tasks related to backend and deployment of the application. After Milestone 1 I have implemented, tested, documented and deployed many number of endpoints. The endpoints I was responsible after Milestone 1 are "get all users", "get all art items", "get user by id", "get art item by id", "get tag by id", "get comment by id", "get exhibition by id", "get notification by id", "get followers of user", "get followings of user", "get favourites of user", "get comments of user", "get exhibitions of user", "get notifications of user", "get favourites of art item", "get comments of art item", "create art item", "create exhibition", "follow a user", "favourite an art item", "comment on an art item" and "get homepage of a user". 

Besides implementing all these endpoints, I have written helper functions, token controls and unit tests for each of them. I have also documented all of the endpoints in the backend by Postman Collections. Then I was responsible for deploying new features to our EC2 host machine in AWS Cloud. For management related works, I was responsible for planning and refactoring backend endpoints after meetings with Mobile and Frontend teams. Lastly I was one of the people who feed our Prod DB with the example data before the Milestone 2 demo. Finally I have spent much time on refactoring the folder structure of our application and the codes we have written previously.

For the Milestone 2 group report, I was responsibile for API documentation/example endpoints part and the last part about the Deployment of the application.

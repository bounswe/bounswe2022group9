## Responsibilities
After the first milestone, the first thing I needed to do was the page where the details of the art item were shown, because we were showing the preview of the art items on the profile and on the feed page, now the details had to be shown as well. Afterwards, I was interested in the routes that can be reached from this page and corrected the points that could cause the problem. For example, the display page of the people who like the art item.

## Main Contributions

In the first milestone, we prepared the user interface of even some of the parts in front of the project plan. I drafted the pages to be displayed in the second milestone until their backend was ready, and then I dealt with their backend connection.

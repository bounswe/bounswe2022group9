## Responsibilites

I initially understood the project and created personal wiki page because i am a new member of this group. Also I rivised the scenarios and mockups.
My main tasks until the milestone1 were creating forget password page and creating feed page mockup. After the first milestone, I have created settings page and exhibition page. In settings page fields for changing information about user's name, birthdate, email, 
profile photo and location. In the exhibition page, you can navigate to see your created exhibitions and you can create new exhibition with exhibition name, 
description of the exhibition, type of exhibition, location, starting time, ending time, date and art item which is included in the exhibition. Additionally i took
notes in some meetings. After the second milestone I treid to make the backend connections of the settings and exhibitions. However it is not well connected, when we 
the codes to the origin there is problems and due to my local changes we couldn't handle and we didn't use them.

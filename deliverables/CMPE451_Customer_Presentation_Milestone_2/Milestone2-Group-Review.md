  ## Annotations
  
 In the backend side: As instructors of the course said a seperate API for annotations should be created. To do so:
 * we created a new Django project, added a new empty app into it
 * created a seperated PotgreSQL database, connected the database to the app
 * added a "waiting for database" command to prevent the app starts before the database (otherwise, errors related to database may occur)
 * dockerized this empty app-database pair.
 
 As a result, we can say that, we created the "basic infrastructure" to start implementing the annotations API.
 We didn't started to implement the API yet.
 
 We are planning to implement the annotations until Milestone 3 and present annotations in the Milestone Presentation.
 
 ## Standards
 
 Since, we didn't implement annotations yet, we aren't able to talk about it'a compatibility with standards.
 We will implement annotations and evaluate it's compatibility with standards at Milestone 3.
